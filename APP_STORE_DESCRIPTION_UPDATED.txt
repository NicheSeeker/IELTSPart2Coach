WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME YOU SPOKE WITHOUT FEAR OF BEING JUDGED?

That's what we built this app for.

Most IELTS apps treat you like a test score. We treat you like a human being with something to say.

WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU OPEN THE APP

  1. You see a speaking topic (authentic IELTS Part 2 style)
  2. You get 60 seconds to prepare
  3. You speak for up to 2 minutes
  4. You receive gentle, personalized feedback

NO RED MARKS. NO STRESS. JUST LISTENING.

THE FEEDBACK YOU DESERVE

After speaking, you won't see a harsh score. Instead:

  • A warm summary: "Your story was engaging and easy to follow..."
  • One helpful tip: "Try varying your sentence rhythm..."
  • Band scores across 4 areas (Fluency, Vocabulary, Grammar, Pronunciation)—but hidden by default. Reveal them when you're ready.
  • A phrase you said that shows your authentic voice
  • Optional transcript: See exactly what you said (can be toggled off)

IT FEELS LIKE TALKING TO A KIND TEACHER

Our AI doesn't correct every tiny mistake. It listens for what you're trying to say and helps you say it more clearly next time.

DESIGNED TO BE BEAUTIFUL AND CALM

  • Liquid Glass design (inspired by modern iOS aesthetics)
